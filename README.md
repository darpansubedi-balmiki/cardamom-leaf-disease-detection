# Cardamom Leaf Disease Detection System

A full-stack application for detecting diseases in cardamom leaves using deep learning. The system classifies images into three categories:
- **Colletotrichum Blight**
- **Phyllosticta Leaf Spot**
- **Healthy**

The backend uses PyTorch with U2-Net for background removal and EfficientNetV2 for classification, along with Grad-CAM visualization. The frontend is a React TypeScript application built with Vite.
