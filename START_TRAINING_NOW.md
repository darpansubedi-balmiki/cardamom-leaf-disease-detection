# 🚀 START TRAINING NOW - Quick Guide

## You Have Data! Let's Train! 🎉

Your dataset is ready with **1,724 images** across 3 disease classes.

---

## ⚡ 3-Step Quick Start

### Step 1: Open Terminal in Backend Folder
```bash
cd backend
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (if not done)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ✅ All dependencies now included: torch, torchvision, tqdm, matplotlib, etc.

### Step 3: Start Training!
```bash
python train.py
```

**That's it!** Training will start immediately.

## ⏱️ What to Expect

### Training Time:
- **GPU (CUDA)**: 30-60 minutes
- **Apple Silicon (MPS)**: 1-2 hours  
- **CPU**: 3-6 hours

### You'll See:
```
Using device: cuda
Dataset path: dataset

Dataset loaded:
Training samples: 1206
Validation samples: 258
Classes: ['colletotrichum_blight', 'phyllosticta_leaf_spot', 'healthy']

Model created: EfficientNetV2-S

Starting training for 50 epochs...
============================================================

Epoch 1/50
------------------------------------------------------------
Training: 100%|████████| 38/38 [00:45<00:00, loss=0.8234, acc=65.42%]
Validation: 100%|████████| 9/9 [00:05<00:00]

Epoch 1 Results:
Train Loss: 0.8234 | Train Acc: 65.42%
Val Loss:   0.6821 | Val Acc:   72.48%
✓ Best model saved! (Val Acc: 72.48%)
```

Training will continue automatically until:
- ✅ Reaches 50 epochs, OR
- ✅ No improvement for 10 consecutive epochs (early stopping)

## 📊 Target Performance

With your 1,724 images, expect:

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Validation Accuracy | **85-92%** |
| Training Time | **30-60 min** (GPU) |
| Final Model Size | **~48 MB** |
| Confidence on correct predictions | **>80%** |

---

## ✅ After Training Completes

You'll have:

1. **✓ Trained Model**: `backend/models/cardamom_model.pt`
2. **✓ Training Plot**: `backend/training_history.png`
3. **✓ Console Output**: Final accuracy statistics

### Next: Evaluate Your Model

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

This will show:
- ✅ Accuracy on test set (260 images)
- ✅ Per-class performance
- ✅ Confusion matrix
- ✅ Confidence analysis

### Then: Deploy It!

```bash
# Start the backend server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The API will automatically load your trained model!

Check the logs for:
```
✓ Loaded trained model weights from models/cardamom_model.pt
Model is trained: True
```

### Test It!

1. Open web app: `http://localhost:5173`
2. Upload a cardamom leaf image
3. See accurate prediction with high confidence! 🎯

---

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'torch'"
```bash
pip install torch torchvision
```

### Training too slow on CPU
```bash
# Use Google Colab with free GPU
# Or reduce batch size in train.py: BATCH_SIZE = 16
```

### "CUDA out of memory"
```bash
# Reduce batch size in train.py
# Change: BATCH_SIZE = 32
# To: BATCH_SIZE = 16
```

## 📈 What Good Training Looks Like

### ✅ Good Signs:
- Training accuracy increasing (60% → 95%)
- Validation accuracy increasing (50% → 90%)
- Loss decreasing (1.0 → 0.1)
- Gap between train/val < 10%

### ⚠️ Warning Signs:
- Both accuracies stuck at 33% (not learning)
- Train 95%, Val 60% (overfitting - but early stopping will handle this)
- Loss increasing (learning rate issue)
